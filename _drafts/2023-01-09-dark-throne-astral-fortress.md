Darkthrone in 2022 is not the same as Darkthrone in 1992, but 99% of you already know that. The other 1% are listening to Five Finger Death Punch and don’t care.  
  
To keep it short, “Astral Fortress” sounds exactly like what it is, two metal laureates having a good time doing what they do best - writing and performing Heavy Metal songs. “Astral…” is not “Blaze…” but the signature sound of the Nocturno Culto and Fenriz collab is unmistakable. Doesn’t matter if it’s fast, slow or in between. They always keep the production lo-fi and lean and emphasize multi-faceted simplicity… which sounds absurd but that’s as far as my limited vocabulary will take me.  
  
A lot of folks have been calling “Astral…” a Doom Metal album in vibe and I would mostly agree. The songs - aside from short chunks most evident in the engaging “Caravan of Broken Ghosts” and galloping closer “Eon 2”… are either slow to mid-tempo type, faintly reminiscent of Celtic Frost. “Kevorkian Times”, outside of “Caravan…” and the 10-minute epic “Sea Beneath the Sea” are my choice cuts. “Kevorkian Times” is just cool b/c of the name. Kinda encapsulates our mass despair as the chapter closes on the human race.  
  
Speaking of song names and we’ll throw in lyrics too, either the guys are being purposely abstract or they have an awkward grasp of the English language or they’re having a laugh. Maybe all three. Who names a song “Impeccable Caverns of Satan”? Or “Stalagmite Necklace”?? Awesome names, but bet you the $10 Amazon gift card I got in my stocking, both are giggling like two school girls.   
  
Love the album though, definitely in my top 5 of 2022. There’s beauty in simplicity. And awkward English.
