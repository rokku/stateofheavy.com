'Come My Fanatics' is Electrics Wizard's Mona Lisa - a masterpiece that's kinda ugly, if I'm honest.   
  
But I mean that in the best possible way. 

Electric Wizard!! The S/T is my go-to, then the “Supercoven/Burnout” EP. That’s when they decided to take traditional Doom Metal and high dive into weird, hallucinatory dimensions beyond human understanding. That’s when they totally went on their own program. Totally original, totally unique. “Come My Fanatics” is 3rd on my list. Great record - “Doom Mantia” is killer. It’s like listening to “Master of Reality”
