How is it _Cleansing_ was released in 1994 and 2023 Tommy Victor still looks relatively like 1994 Tommy Victor?!  He's like Peter Pan, this guy.  Full head of hair, trim and fit.  I, on the other hand, look like Father Time kicked my ass. Twice. 

 I love Prong. _Cleansing_ is a perfect album. Every song is a gift from the Gods. The follow-up,  _Rude Awakening_... that was rough.  I give Tommy and company all the credit in the world for not sticking with the tried and true and embracing new ideas, but it didn't resonate.  2007's _Power of the Damager_ though, that resonated.  Super-aggressive, almost Thrash-like approach.  I think Tommy is not a big fan of that one, but I dig it.  

I'm rambling - the topic is the new single "Breaking Point" - Tommy has always been good at writing very f'ing angry protest songs.  One of the best, actually alongside from Bob Dylan and Millie Petrozza.  From what I've been reading, the inspiration was the COVID pandemic... everyone cooped up and frightened, raids on grocery stores for supplies, friends and family dying... add to that constant barrage of information and misinformation coming from both the media and government.  A lot to be angry about. Then the transition into war, high profile mass shootings and the brutal tribalism between the left and the right... "Breaking Point" is a reflection of the current ill-tempered, politically charged and partially homicidal zeitgeist.     

 "Breaking Point" sounds like a return to the _Cleansing_ sound.  And I love it.  We're back to that extremely heavy and chunky sound, where every downbeat feels like a concussion grenade.  It's the perfect, hyper-aggressive soundtrack to Tommy's hyper-angry lyrics.  There's no metaphors or allegories for you to dig through - it's as straight forward as lyrics get.  And they're clearly pissed. 

You can't judge what an entire album will sound like based on one song, but it is a positive predictive value for good stuff coming our way later this year.  Hope I'm right.
