Brant Bjork.  He's single handedly taken the 70's Stoner trope and squeezed that motherfucker like a lemon. In a vice.  Never wavered. Stared straight ahead and went for it.  And he's still doing it, some 35 years after he teamed up with his pal and former Kyuss bandmate Nick Oliveri to form Kyuss.  Those two dudes helped _invent_ Desert Rock (also known as "Stoner Rock", which, given the context of this review, we'll stick with).  With individual and collective stints in bands like Queens of the Stone Age, Che', Vista Chino and Fu Manchu, they're Desert Rock...erm.. Stone Rock, OGs. 

Brant Bjork and Nick Oliveri are Desert Rock OGs.  In cahoots with John Garcia and Josh Homme, they _invented_ Desert Rock (also known as "Stoner Rock") with the immensely influential and musically magical Kyuss.  Never mind their stints both individually and collectively in bands like Queens of the Stone Age, Che', Mondo Generator, Dwarves, Vista Chino and Fu Manchu.  

 (also known as "Stoner Rock", which, given the context of this review and the name of the band, we'll stick with). 

So much respect for OG Desert Rock vet Brant Bjork.  He co-founded and was a creative linchpin incredible Desert Rock legends Kyuss. He was also a creative force, playing and producing in Fu Manchu. Then there's the star-crossed project with his ex-Kyuss pals (sans Josh) and then there's his notable solo career not to mention Che', Fatso Jetson, etc.  He's single handedly  taken the 70's stoner trope and squeezed that motherfucker like a lemon. In a vice.  Never wavered. Stared straight ahead and went for it.  And he's still doing it, some 35 years after he teamed up with his high school buddies to form Kyuss.

With his Stöner project, he teams up with ex-Kyuss / Mondo Generator / Dwarves / Queens of the Stone Age wunderkind dude, Nick Oliveri, whom also is a founding father of the Desert rock scene as well as Brant's solo project drummer, Ryan Güt. 

Through my almost 20 year stint as Hesh Rock journalist with Ultimate Metal, Custom Heavy and Hellride Music, I burned out on Stoner Rock in the worse way.
