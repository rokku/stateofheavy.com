Brant Bjork.  He's single-handedly taken the 70's Stoner trope and squeezed that motherfucker like a lemon in a vice.  Never wavered. Stared straight ahead and went for it.  And he's still got the pedal to the medal some 35 years after he teamed up with his pal and former Kyuss bandmate Nick Oliveri to form half of said legendary band.  Those two dudes helped _invent_ Desert Rock (also known as "Stoner Rock", which, given the context of this review, we'll stick with).  With individual and collective stints in bands like Queens of the Stone Age, Che', Vista Chino, Fatso Jetson, Mondo Generator, and Fu Manchu plus Brant's solo projects, they're Stoner Rock OGs. 

Stöner is Brant, Nick and Brant Bjork's solo project timekeeper, Ryan Güt.  I haven't kept up with the Stoner scene in a lonnnnng time, but Wikipedia says Stöner has two albums and the EP I'm going to type about now, _Boogie to Baja_.  All on the [Heavy Psych Sounds](https://www.heavypsychsounds.com/) label.

After an almost 20 year stint as Hesh Rock journalist reviewing Stoner Rock and Doom and it's various sub-genres almost exclusively, I burnt put on both. Bad.   _Boogie to Baja_ is the first all-out Stoner Rock album I've listened to in at least 5-6 years and I have to say that... I'm still burnt out on Stoner Rock, but marginally less.

This marginal shift is largely due to the exceptional free-wheelin' jazz-like quality of "Night Tripper vs No Brainer",  a 7 and a half minute fuzz-drenched opus composed in two movements.  Holy shit did it hit all my groove erogenous zones.  Case in point is when that swing kicks in at the 2:50 mark... sweet baby Jesus is that something!  Groove x 10.  I even like the weird call/response thing that goes on. "When the church bell rings" -> "It goes dingalingaling".  

The all-instrumental title track is also of note. Honestly, I've heard more Stoner Rock than a man should hear in the course of a lifetime, but the 10 minute "Boogie to Baja" is one of the best jams sessions to cross my ears.  Very reminiscent of one of my favorite bands of all time, [Colour Haze](https://www.colourhaze.de/en/).  

I may be fried on fuzz, but it seems the musical chemistry between these three dudes is off-the-charts amazing.  Hope you get a chance to check it out.
