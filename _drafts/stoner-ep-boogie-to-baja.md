Brant Bjork.  He's single handedly taken the 70's Stoner trope and squeezed that motherfucker like a lemon. In a vice.  Never wavered. Stared straight ahead and went for it.  And he's still doing it, some 35 years after he teamed up with his pal and former Kyuss bandmate Nick Oliveri to form Kyuss.  Those two dudes helped _invent_ Desert Rock (also known as "Stoner Rock", which, given the context of this review, we'll stick with).  With individual and collective stints in bands like Queens of the Stone Age, Che', Vista Chino, Fatso Jetson, Mondo Generator, and Fu Manchu plus Brant's solo projects, they're Desert Rock...erm.. Stone Rock, OGs. 

Stöner is Brant, Nick and Brant Bjork's solo project timekeepr, Ryan Güt.  I haven't kept up with the Stoner scene a lonnnnng time, but Wikipedia says Stöner has two albums and the EP I'm going to type about now, _Boogie to Baja_.  All on the burgeoning Heavy Psych Sounds label. 

After an almost 20 year stint as Hesh Rock journalist reviewing Stoner Rock and Doom and it's various sub-genres exclusively, I burned out on both. Bad.   _Boogie to Baja_ is the first all-out Stoner Rock album I've listened to in at least 5-6 years.
