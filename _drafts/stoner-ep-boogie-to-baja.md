So much respect for OG Desert Rock vet Brant Bjork.  He co-founded and was a creative linchpin incredible Desert Rock legends Kyuss. He was also a creative force, playing and producing in Fu Manchu. Then there's the star-crossed project with his ex-Kyuss pals (sans Josh) and then there's his notable solo career not to mention Che', Fatso Jetson, etc.  He's single handedly  taken the 70's stoner trope and squeezed that motherfucker like a lemon. In a vice.  Never wavered. Stared straight ahead and went for it.  And he's still doing it, some 35 years after he teamed up with his high school buddies to form Kyuss.  

With his Stöner project, he teams up with ex-Kyuss / Mondo Generator / Dwarves
