One of the joys of deciding that you're going to start a music blog again is breaking out of your Spotify Repeat playlist, with the same however-many songs which are just the same ones you've been listening to for the last 12 months, and deciding: right, *now* is the time I'm going to listen to some **new shit**.

20 years ago I ran a music review site + forum called [UltimateMetal.com](https://www.ultimatemetal.com) before selling it on to a friend, after the upkeep became too much. I've missed it ever since. 

I was never one to live on the cutting edge of music, always spending too much time tied to my old favourites from the 70s and 80s, and as someone who was curating reviews of new music from a team of volunteer writers, I felt some level of guilt that I wasn't as hands-on with knowing who the fuck these bands were. 

(Not THAT guilty, but a little)

But with the advent of this site, STATE OF HEAVY, I hope to not only celebrate the heaviness that has come before us, but the heaviness that is being gifted to us by men and women turning up to 11 and throwing down on some serious fucking power chords (and widdly-widdly bits). Stoner rock, death metal, Finnish power anthems, and everything inbetween. 

If I enjoy it, it'll be featured here in some way.

Reviews, ruminations, or just news links. I hope to have it all. But at the end of the day, this will be a personal site where I celebrate the Heavy.
