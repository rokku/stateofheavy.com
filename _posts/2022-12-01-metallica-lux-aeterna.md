Metallica return with a surprise for everyone, a new single which harkens back to c1984 levels of thrash that personally I don't think Metallica have exhibited with gusto since Ride The Lightning, but obviously filtered through the 38 years since.

Hetfields tight, wrist-numbing downstrokes over Ulrich's machine-gun double bass, Hammet's classic old-time solo tearing up anything above the 12th fret, and Trujillo rooting it all down to a classic old-time Metallica stampede like we have heard them - at least **this** clearly - for decades IMO.

Fuckin' A.
