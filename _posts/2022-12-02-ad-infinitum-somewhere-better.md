As a lead single from their upcoming LP, Chapter III - Downfall, AD INFINITUM drop 'Somewhere Better', a rather splendid but albeit by-the-numbers symphonic turn which wouldn't be entirely out of place in a Eurovision final (but then, same could be said for most symphonic metal tracks, let's be honest). 

Melissa Bonny's vocals are gorgeous, the music is crisp, and overall the song is a strong precursor to next March's album. I'm looking forward to hearing more.
