Nothing genre-defining occurs in the 48 minutes of HIGH COMMAND's second LP, but what does occur is a strong, 8-track callback to classic American thrash (particularly SLAYER), with some flavours of KREATOR (see track 5, 'Fortified By Bloodshed') at times as well. Both these comparisons are nothing but praise from this writer.

Kicking off in style with the title track, High Command very proudly fly their US thrash flag. The Slayer influence is, to my ears, incredibly strong and that's not a bad thing. Punching heavily through medium-paced riffs, coarse vocals and a rhythm section that's tighter than a gnat's bumhole. This track also leads off with twin guitars laying down co-harmonies around themselves, and... they sadly stop, while the main song marches on. Shame.

Things continue in much the same vein until the third track, Imposing Hammers of Cold Sorcery, a near-8-minute track which opens promisingly with with clean guitars adding some nice, subtle colour to the album before crashing into yet another medium-paced riff. This song is one to stick with though, as it shows varying themes through its 8 minutes while still maintaining the head-banging no-nonsense chugs that you'll find throughout this album.

Skipping ahead past the aformentioned 'Fortified by Bloodshed' - a treat of Germanic-thrash riffery - to track 6, Chamber of Agony which gives us what Imposing Hammers... promised earlier, with almost 90 seconds of acoustic intro to set a grand scene for the rest of the song.

Siege Warfare, the album's penultimate track, is pure thrash genius. Mix up Slayer, METALLICA, MEGADETH - all in their early days - and you have an exciting, head down speedfest.

All in all, **Eclipse of the Dual Moons** is a worthy listen if your game is thrash and you love the genre, especially its roots from the early 80s without sound dated. High Command break no rules, but if their end game is to make a solid outing that will get pit circles forming, then they will have achieved it here.
