Latest LP from Chilean guitar wunderkind Pancho Ireland, MERCILESS LAW show that classic power metal isn't dead, with 8 songs which wouldn't be out of place anytime from the late 80s to the early 2000s. 

It lacks the polish of their European brothers, but the songs are solid, the guitar work is simply excellent, and above all else the melodies are worth a listen. Solid.
