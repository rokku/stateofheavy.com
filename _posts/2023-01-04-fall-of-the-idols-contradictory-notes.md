I’ve always given Finland’s immensely talented Fall of the Idols credit for being the grimmest of Doom Metal bands. 2008’s _The Seance_ followed by 2012’s _Solemn Verses_ were downright oppressive. It’s hard to say why - they aren’t the heaviest _sounding_ band on the planet - if monster, crushing riffs is your definition of “heavy”, then there’s plenty of those, most of them pretty boring. FOTI applies the “X Factor” for their brand of heavy - tone, haunting melodies, lyrics that have real meaning in place of the usual occult mumbo jumbo and a singer in Jyrki Hakomaki that takes “emotive” to new levels. While I was typing this, there’s another element that sets FOTI apart from the usual comparators like Mirror of Deception and Warning. Those bands capture sorrow incredibly well… FOTI not only capture sorrow, but palpable anger… an element that is not common in Doom Metal. That is definitely unique to FOTI.

_Contradictory Notes_ is FOTI’s first album in 10 years and the first since the suicide of drummer/songwriter and friend Hannu Weckman. The album serves both as a tribute to Hannu as well as a showcase for songs slightly outside the usual FOTI output. Conceptually, _Contradictory…_ has a very heavy psycho-social vibe, specifically how those that wield power exploit the ones that don’t. The anger is seething… there’s blood, sweat and tears in Jyrki’s delivery. I firmly believe that _Contradictory…_would not have the visceral impact it does without Jyrki. There are a couple of times that he sounds like he’s on the verge of popping a blood vessel. The production on the album is exceptional as well… the ethereal, unworldly elements and spoken word passages are genius and I can see why this album earned the title it did. It’s firmly FOTI, but FOTI expanding their boundaries with added experimentation vs the straight-forward doom metal of previous albums. I can’t help think of Anathema, but way more pissed-off. I’m told that this is called “musical evolution”

_Contradictory Notes_ is a fitting tribute to a fallen friend as well as a chance for the band to stretch their wings a bit.
