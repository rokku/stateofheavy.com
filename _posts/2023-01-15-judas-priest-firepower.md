What a magnificent testament to good ol' fashioned Heavy Metal JP's "Firepower" is.  JP was in town in the Summer and I blew it off for a constellation of pitiful excuses - a) LA traffic b) had to get up early the next day and c) I'm old.  Now, of course, I have major regret.  Rob's no spring chicken and who knows when... or if... they'll come back. Another poor choice by Old Man Barnes. 

I'm five years late to "Firepower", I kind of lost track of JP after "Painkiller" and heard the post-Ripper material Rob recorded wasn't a huge improvement from the Ripper material. Which was pretty... not good.   I came across "Firepower" via Andy Sneap's Wikipedia page.  I love the Sneap sound, that dude is the heir apparent to Martin Birch.  I had no idea that he co-produced "Firepower", so like any heavy metal journalist worth their salt, I avoided the reviews and dove in with mind wide open.  I was blown away.  Fifty plus years after formation, they are still bringing it. 

The whole album is extraordinary Heavy Metal - with 14 tracks, the law of averages would say there's bound to be a "Last Rose of Summer", but they beat the odds somehow.  There are three exceptional tracks... the first two, "Firepower" (outside of "Painkiller" the fastest track I've heard from JP), "Lighting Strike" and "Traitor's Gate" that I'd put amongst the best tracks that JP has put to record. Honestly, they're that good. I love KK , he's legend, and will always have a place in my heart - although I do think it's weird he was selling his own cologne, but OK - but the Faulkner/Tipton songwriting combo seems to be especially on fire here and Rob continues his tradition of creating some of the best HM characters of all time - the Necromancer, Flame Thrower, the Spectre and, of course, the Devil.  

I'd go into each track but this review is already long and pretty boring - the only thing I'll say is if you're a JP fan, you'll most likely not be disappointed, and maybe even elated.  I know they're pretty much done with a new album to be released this year (2023). Hope they can keep the momentum up for what will be album #19.  Also hope that Glenn's condition stabilizes - Parkinson's is an awful disease. Very glad he's ambulatory enough to make it on stage for an appearance most nights.
