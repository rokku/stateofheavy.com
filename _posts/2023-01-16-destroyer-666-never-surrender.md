I'm not a huge Black Thrash guy, mostly because there's a concerted effort to make the mix sound like it's coming out of a transistor radio.  But I'll always put on the brakes for K.K. Warslut, the very...uh... mercurial... and occasionally (very) offensive front man/guitarist and primary songwriter for long-running Aussie Black Thrash band, Deströyer 666.  

Over the holidays, my friend Mike - whose Metal opinions I deeply respect -reached out to tell me about how great the song "Pitch Black Night" was off the new D666 album, _Never Surrender_.  Being perpetually out of touch, I didn't even know they _had_ a new album, but quickly took action. 

Mike was right. "Pitch Black Night" is insanely good and I can see a lively crowd chant in the making. Listen, you'll see.  I'll say the same thing about the whole frigging album.  The title track is the Heavy Metal equivalent of "Eye of the Tiger" (the song from the movie _Rocky_, for you young 'uns) - it's a mental pick-me-up, and I'm dead serious about that. I mean, don't get me wrong, _Never Surrender_ isn't self-help or anything, but there is an underlying message of overcoming adversity, bravery in battle... and life is pretty much a battle... and maintaining honor that I find appealing.  The "slaying your enemies" aspect resonates too. Maybe too much for some people. Like me. Haha. 

You'll also want to check out the unrelenting Black Thrash attack of "Grave Raiders", which is like a Viking "Run to the Hills"-esque tale of attempted Genocide (that's my take, anyway).  "Rather Death" is a must listen for discerning aggro Thrash fans - it's the most aggressive track on an album brimming with aggressive tracks, a remorseless tale of the Sack of Rome that has KK spitting lyrics like flaming arrows over the heads of rushing hordes. The final of my favorites is a slower, sea-faring epic called "Batavia's Graveyard. about the shipwreck of the Batavia and infamously brutal God-inspired mutineer Jeronimus Cornelisz. "Axed, hacked, battered, drowned" is weirdly catchy. 

 Really a tremendous album that offers an opportunity for Deströyer 666 to expand their fan base.  No, seriously, it's that good.  Listen and tell me I'm wrong.  On second thought, don't do that, but I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy _Never Surrender_.
