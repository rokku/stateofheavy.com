With this, their self-titled fifth album, Beyond The Black have a solid slab of symphotic-esque metal. I say 'esque' as while there potential for each track to get away from itself with the _widdly-widdly_, the band show great restraint in keeping everything to the service of the song.

Blasting off with absolutely hook-ridden opener, 'Is There Anyone Out There', Beyond The Black - a group I'd never even heard of before I began listening to this - show their mettle. The weird almost-clown-horn sound at the start, and later in the song, is... well, it's out of place, but fortunately doesn't ruin what quickly becomes a firm toe-tapper of a track.

Lead singles 'Reincarnation' and 'Dancing in the Dark' are both crackers, and 'Free Me' (for which they've put out a video) is an epic in 4 minutes, with a gorgeous chorus and astute pacing.

If you're into germanic power metal, then you're no doubt already away of Beyond The Black. If not, do your ears a favour and pour this album into them.
