I have a soft spot for Germanic Power Metal. I remember renting a VHS tape in the 80s of a German metal showcase with the likes of Warlock, Running Wild and others, all pretending to play in front of an audience (with canned audience applause and everything). It was glorious, it was cheesy, it was metal.

CROM ring that bell quite solidly for me: a highly-melodic, heaving, pushing-forward metal band with a thick accent. I wouldn't think this out of place if I was riding a stinking Warg into battle against some filthy hobbitses. From the out, The Era Of Darkness - Crom's fourth full length release - stomps your shit.

The album isn't without it's weak points - some songs, such as Together We Ride, plod a little, draggint their feet where others move with momentum, but the rest of the album is solid. Listen to Riding into the Sun and tell me a circle pit doesn't form in your head.

Finally recording as a trio after previous releases being a one-man show of Walter Grosse (aka "Crom"), The Era of Darkness is a release to be proud of, and one which I'm sure will set summer Festival audiences across Europe agog.
