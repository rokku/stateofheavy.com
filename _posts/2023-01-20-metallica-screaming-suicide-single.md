Metallica, the kinky fucks, are edging their fans further by releasing Screaming Suicide, the latest single off their forthcoming whatever-they're-calling-it LP.

However, unlike the joy which was Lux Ã†terna, which - as [I wrote previously](https://www.stateofheavy.com/metallica-lux-aeterna/) - was a blast from the best of their musical past, this single is a blast from the worst of their 90s doggerel. I hate to say it.

The solo sounds like Kirk just learnt his first box pentatonic, and the rest is like someone asked an AI to generate a Metallica song.

This isn't particularly fun to listen to, and Lars owes his hi-hat an apology.
