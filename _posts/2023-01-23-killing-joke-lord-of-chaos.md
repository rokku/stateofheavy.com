The kinda new Killing Joke EP _Lord of Chaos_ is really good - two new tracks and two remixes. The title track is outstanding in the worst possible way… war, world-wide unrest, climate-change-induced fungal blooms and the human conditions that make it possible. The stuff of anxiety, insomnia and benzodiazepine sales.  It's such a weird, drastic 180 from “Pylon”’s hyper-optimistic bouncer “Big Buzz” remix, definiately an emotional boomerang.  

Like most Killing Joke releases, it's tough to label. Closest I can come is 80's New Wave.  Any of these tracks would be right at home on early '80's KROQ in LA as I was driving my Datsun B210 from high school to my girlfriend's house.  It's a little nostalgic, really. 

Man do I love Killing Joke. They’re poignant, they’re weird and always - seriously, always - on their own program.
