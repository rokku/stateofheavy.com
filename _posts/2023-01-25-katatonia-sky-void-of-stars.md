Sky Void of Stars is the first Katatonia album I've listened to since 2003's Viva Emptiness, which defined my year as I struggled to adapt to a new country, with its melodic and emotive sounds helping with all sorts of shit I'm not going to go into here. 

But I owe Katatonia a lot, more than I have done since it's been TWENTY FUCKING YEARS between drinks. Sky Void... is Katatonia as I remember them, craftsmen of gorgeous, layered metal that is defined by interwined melodies through a melancholic filter. 

The entire album is captivating from the first second. Welcome back to my heart, Katatonia.
