I tolerate Iron Maiden's Kevin Shirley years like I tolerate my in-laws - with love, but with some disdain and quiet annoyance.

Iron Maiden is my favorite band of any genre.  They are and will always be the best Heavy Metal band that is and will even be. Unparalleled, really.  Those Martin Birch years... man!  Legendary!  That producer/band creative chemistry in one in a million.  OK, there was _No Prayer for the Dying_, but the law of averages was bound to kick in.  And I don't think anyone expected the same quality output post-Birch.  And largely they were right, but I do think everything from _Brave New World_ to _A Matter of Life and Death_ have their moments of brilliance (especially the latter). But, to me anyway, there has been a steady decline of memorable songs starting with _The Final Frontier_, then moving on to the mostly nap-inducing _Book of Souls_ and hitting nadir with _Senjutsu._ Man, that is painful for me to get through.  And it pains me to say that.

My experience with _Senjutsu_ is the first three songs are outstanding - and also translated well to the live experience on their recent _Legacy of the Beast_ tour. But everything after...ooooofffff.  And I tried _really_ hard to like the remainder of that album but those songs are brutally uninteresting.  I just wanted the band to speed up - not for every song- but give me an up-tempo song to get the blood shaking.  Or at least edit down the album - no shame in that, they shouldn't feel compelled to pack in every songs. Some songs are worth the pack.  There's really no pressure to stuff in s sub-average song in order to make your album and hour and 28 minutes.

I 'm pretty sure I'll get sh*t about this from die-hards and that's OK.  I also love the Blaze years, and know many won't agree with me there either.  I'm only speaking for myself, I don't have a burning need for everyone to agree with me. But it might be time for 'Arry to date other producers.  Other ideas and opportunities for creative collaboration exist - might be time to shake things up - how about Roy Z for instance?  Look at the magic he and Bruce cooked up.   Billy Anderson? Nah, that'd be weird.  Andy Sneap, maybe? Did wonders for Judas Priest.

Or you can tell me to fuck off. That's OK too. I hear worse from my wife.
