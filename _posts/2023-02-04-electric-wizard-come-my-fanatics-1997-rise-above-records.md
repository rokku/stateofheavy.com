'Come My Fanatics...' is Electric Wizard's Mona Lisa - it's absolutely masterpiece, but it's not pretty. 

I mean that in the best possible way.  It makes a weird sort of sense that three young scourges of society from Dorest, England with a collective resume that includes car arson in front of a police station; slipping off the roof and falling through a window of a church while trying to steal the rooftop crucifix; smashing a liquor store window and grabbing a bottle of whiskey only to sit on the curb in front of the store to enjoy it, and other colorful instances of theft and petty larceny - would have the kind of background that would set them up for success in Heavy Metal (in relative terms).  I don't think anyone with a college degree and clean police record could make the music that Electric Wizard makes.  It wouldn't make sense

Unquestionably, Electric Wizard defined a genre with 'Come My Fanatics...' While their peers  in the 90's were fiddling around with violins and keyboards (no disrespect to Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, Anathema and similar), The Wiz took Black Sabbath at its most druggy, added Grateful Dead-length jams and generally took a high dive into weird, hallucinatory dimensions beyond human understanding.  

Weed, Witches and Satan. And occasionally Lovecraft and vintage horror films are all lyrical fodder for Electric Wizard.  Believe it or not, this was novel back in the 90's.  Now you can't get away from it - The Wiz launched a legion of imitators -  not to say that some weren't good, but by '99 bands with very similar sound and lyrical theme were coming out of the woodwork.  And, a quarter century later, we're still trying to dig out from the rubble of Stoner Doom cliche'. 

But it's good to pay tribute to the OGs, now 26 some odd years down the dark, wooded path.  Truly pioneers , "Come My Fanatics..." is a perfect totem to their legacy.  You should listen.
