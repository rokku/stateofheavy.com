I completely missed Heathen's existence which is an insult to both of us.   As a (relatively) young Hesher back in the late 80's and 90's, I should have been all about this.  I first heard 'Victims of Deception' a few months ago and it was a revelation - a different breed of Thrash... definite prog/technical aspects... but still maintained the essential elements of heaviness (VERY heavy), speed and aggression.  Plus, it openly criticized the criminal enterprise of Christianity, which I happen to be a huge fan of.  If 'Victims...' were released in the early '80's instead of the early 90's, it would have taken Metal community by stormd.  1991 was not a good year for metal. Hard to compete with Seattle-based flannel-clad youth.  

"Victims of Deception" led me down a twisted path to 2020's "Empire of the Blind", the band's 4th album.  What a monster.  To me, Heathen are the perfect bridge between Testament and Exodus... more melodic than Testament (and without the asynchronous guitar noodling) and equally heavy as Officer Holt and company, but with vocal dude that has an epic voice (no offense to Zetro, just a different style).  The Exodus/Heathen bond is tight, main songwriter and guitarist Kragen Lum filled Gary's spot in Exodus during Gary's Slayer years, alongside fellow Heathen, Exodus's Lee Altus.  

What an album 'Empire...' is.  In a crappy turn of fate, it was released right before COVID hit, tanking touring plans to support the album (they seem to be haunted by unfortunate timing), 'Victim...' may have went undeservedly under the radar.   Kragen Lum is an exceptional Metal songwriter, penning all 12 tracks. Of those, "The Blight", "Empire of the Blind", "Dead and Gone", "Blood to be Let" and especially the pummeling "In Black" are the standout tracks for me, with "A Fine Red Mist" being one of the best purely instrumental tracks I've heard in Thrashdom.

What gives Heathen their unique identity is the interplay of brutal heaviness, melody and technical chops.  The Lum/Altus combo tone is crushing. No joke. That and the melodic timbre of Dave White really give Heathen it's stand-out cred. Lum's task of weaving all of this together into engaging and memorable songs is pretty amazing.   If there's a downside, it's that Lum's lyrics are thoughtful, but man, there is no light on "Empire..."  It's pretty dire. 

Great album, I hear there might be new material coming soon. As I'm writing this, they are hitting Europe this year with an outstanding line-up of Heathen, Overkill and Exhorder.  Now that's a bill!
