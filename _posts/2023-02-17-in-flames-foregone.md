In the early 2000s, In Flames put aside their classic side for what was argued was a more approachable, commercial sound. This angered many in their existing fan base. 

The drummer also started wearing a beanie, which REALLY pissed people off.

For me, the advent of their new sound in 2002's Reroute to Remain was glorious, an album which I lapped up many times over the course of that year and since. 

While I lost touch with them briefly as my own life took its own (less approachable, less commercial) journey, their releases since continued in similar vein of pushing, powerful melodic death metal. Their last full release, 2019's I, The Mask, was simply excellent.

Now, here in the year of Our Jeebus 2023, we have Foregone, a 12-song parcel of - well - much of the same. And it's fucking fire, y'all.

I would even say they've leaned backwards a little to the days of Clayman excellence, but maintain their modern sound of entwirled melody and layered guitars. 

They always make their music sound so simple, while at the same time satisfying that craving for complex metal. 

Modern In Flames is the same brutal-non-violent melod metal that they made 20 years ago. Love.
