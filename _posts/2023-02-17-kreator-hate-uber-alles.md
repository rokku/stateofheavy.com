I'm a huge Kreator guy, not so much their early stuff - which is heresy to many of you - but from _Violent Revolution_ through _Gods of Violence_, man that was a great run.  I can't think of one weak point. Maybe it's a bit glossy in places , but the majority is high octane, aggressive and well-produced Thrash.  Lyrically, Millie is the Bob Dylan of Thrash - the man knows how to pen a protest song. 

Seriously, it might be a bit repetitive, but I dig lyrics that viscerally promote ideas of non-conformity and strength and unity against the forces of oppression. And anger and hate.  I can particularly relate to the latter two. 

But truth be told, _Hate Über Alles_ is a bit of a head scratcher.  The more opened-minded could consider _Hate..._ as an intrepid exploration of new musical ideas. Then dicks like me think that Kreator is coming dangerously close to becoming to Thrash Metal what Arch Enemy is to Death Metal.    
  
Don't get me wrong, there are some absolutely rippin' tracks - the title track is among the best adrenaline catalysts that Kreator has written. "Killer of Jesus" rips, "Strongest of the Strong" is the pre-requisite anthemic track, I happen to like it but it does have its detractors who feel it's too commercial.  "Conquer And Destroy" rips, "Demonic Future" rips, "Pride Comes Before The Fall" rips... but then there's the opener, which may be a bold new idea, but it's weird. I like Spaghetti Western music like the next guy... but... I dunno.  I like the idea of Millie contemplating the past and the inspiration for forming Kreator, but "Become Immortal" is like the new album song that gets played during a concert and everyone leaves to go pee. "Midnight Sun", clearly one of those bold new ideas, and I think inspired by the movie _Midsomma_r - had so much promise.  The opening riff is epic, but then the incongruous female vocals kick in.  while co-writer Sofia Portanet has a beautiful voice, it's one of those bold new ideas that you either embrace or say WTF??.  "Crush the Tyrants" is middling, to be honest.  "Dying Planet" is the first track (that I know of) co-written by new bassist Frédéric Leclercq. Although it may be one of those intrepid new ideas, it has that Arch Enemy Death Metal-lite gloss that just doesn't resonate with me. 

So in summary, _Hate Über Alles_ is Kreator either embracing new ideas - not unlike their 90's era Goth/Industrial period - or just an album that happens to mix grade A high octane thrash with a few glossy, incongruent head scratchers.  But I'll reiterate I'm kind of a dick and want everything to sound like _Gods of Violence_.
