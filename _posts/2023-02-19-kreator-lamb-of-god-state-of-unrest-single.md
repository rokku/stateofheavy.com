The COVID pandemic jacked-up a whole lot of things.  Think of all the lives lost needlessly due to politically motived misinformation campaigns.  That makes my head spin.  Leaders intentionally propagating lies about the efficacy of masks and vaccines to further political agendas.  Sounds like the stuff of any number of Kreator's more sociopolitical output, as fate would have it. 

COVID also squarely kicked the music industry in the nuts as tour after tour was snuffed out due to the outbreak.  Case in point, the planned 2020 - 2021 "State of Unrest" EU/UK tour featuring the co-headlining duo of Kreator and Lamb of God with the great Power Trip in tow, had to be put on ice.  Gratefully, the tour has been resurrected to kick off again this year, but sadly without Power Trip due to the tragic, drug-related death of the late, great Riley Gale (RIP dude, you ruled). 

The "State of Unrest" single is a collab between Kreator and Lamb of God with the intent of not only raising the awareness of the upcoming tour, but also doing some good in the world.  The proceeds from the single will go to [Dallas Hope Charities](https://www.dallashopecharities.org/),  a nonprofit that operates the Hope Center, Dallasâ€™s FIRST LGBTQ+ focused homeless youth center, an organization that Riley championed.  That's some good stuff, right there. 

Sound-wise, the single is pretty good - not fantastic, but pretty good. It's not particularly impactful nor is anything regarding the topic of global chaos really a stretch for either band.  It does have some chug, though, and represents a great opportunity for the bands to share the stage and knock it out, pretty much a guaranteed crowd highlight.  I'm more excited about the charitable concept behind it, that's huge.  I really like when artists do stuff like this and give back to the community.
