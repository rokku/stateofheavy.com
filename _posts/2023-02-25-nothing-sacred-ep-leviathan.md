Sometimes, when I really feel like throwing caution to the wind and getting nuts, I'll pick something random I've never heard from the "New Releases" section on Apple music and listen all the way through.  Sometimes I'll find gold. Mostly, I waste 35 - 60 minutes. Luckily it was the former in this case. 

Nothing Sacred's _Leviathan_ EP was the pick.  I knew nothing about them so did a little [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Sacred_(band)) action and learned that they formed in 1983 and were one of the first bands in Australia to do the Speed/Thrash thing.   Kinda bummed me out, I pride myself on intensive knowledge of Metal's formative years and Nothing Sacred escaped me.  I insulted myself. 

Obviously, starting out in '83 means many of the members are old gits like me, and I take particular liking to people who eschew the contemporary thinking that one "grows out of" Heavy Metal.  I love that they're taking the road less traveled, even if that road leads to a retirement home. 

_Leviathan_ is Heavy Metal in its purest form -  five dudes in jeans and t-shirts that play guitar, bass, drums and vocals. No costumes, no schtick, no keyboards.  They play gritty, catchy and burly Metal with melodies and feature a singer that actually sings vs grunting or caterwauling.  My favorite kind.  

The title track is huge - an aural treatise on standing firm in the face of oppression. I've heard that this song, along with the second track, "Drone", are inspired by the war in the Ukraine. The first, a cheer for the people of Ukraine to remain strong and steadfast, the second a reflection of the horrors of the weaponry  of war.  I can't confirm though, so take that with a couple of grains of salt.  Great Metal though. 

"Guardian" and "Sir Megma", both re-recordings of songs featured on their first full-length,1988's _Let Us Prey_. Both are powerful, singable and aggressive chuggers that benefit from updated production values. I mean REALLY benefit.  They almost sound like new songs.  "Sudden Death" is a re-recording of an unreleased live favorite.  It's akin to the Purp's "Highway Star" or the Sabb 4's "Trashed", but twice as fast and hopped up on Angel Dust.  Great tune.   
  
The last track is a re-mix of "Drone" that was either put there to keep someone happy. Or fill time. Or both

Aside from the re-mix, the EP is fantastic.  Chris Stark has a voice, man.  That guy delivers from the toes on up.  It's great to see the OGs still plugging in and giving it their all while still sounding vital and relevant.  A+
