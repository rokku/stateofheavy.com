I lack the musical vocabulary to explain Hammerhedd's "Nonetheless". I don't think anyone has that kinda vocab, really.  They're on their own program, in their own universe doing their own thing.  The closest I can come is Tool crossed with Prong playing Math Rock with Gene Krupa on drums. Even that doesn't quite capture it.

The band consists of the Ismert brothers, guitarist Henry Ismert, drummer Eli Ismert, and bassist Abe Ismert.  They formed Hammerhedd at the tender ages of 9, 7, and 4, respectively.  Wunderkinds, all of the precocious little uber-talented bastards.  An early claim to fame is repeated performance requests from both _The Ellen DeGeneres Show_ and _America's Got Talent_ as a result of a viral vid of the band playing Metallica covers, reposted by the Metallica guys themselves - all while in their early teens. Fast forward to 2022 and they're touring with [In Flames]().  Geez. My only claim to fame as young teen was a couple of participation trophies.

You have to listen to _Nonetheless_ to get it.  Like Kyuss's stellar _Welcome to Meteor City,_ be sure to listen without distraction.  All of it, the whole things. You'll recognize these lads as the feral polyrhythmic geniuses they are.  The interplay of drums, bass and guitar can only come from that rare chemical click that exists only between siblings... the love, hate, cries and laughs that are part and parcel of family.  It's off the charts amazing to behold. 

The lyrics are also unusual, especially for a Metal band.  They are vaguely abstract but my take is that they're about self-empowerment and overcoming adversity.  My take could be completely wrong though. They could be about buying Twinkies at 7-11, who knows?  Henry Ismert does the vocals and even that is off the beaten path - sort of a harsh, faux-guttural approach that sounds like he's yelling through a toilet paper roll.  Interesting. 

I love turning people on to new sounds, especially when the approach is so unique as to not sound like anything before it.  I hope you check out _Nonetheless_.  There's something special here, even if I suck at describing what that is.
